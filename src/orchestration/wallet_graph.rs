//persistent wallet relationship graph

// wallet_graph.rs: Models wallet relationships (age, activity similarity, IP co-occurrence) as a graph using a library like petgraph to avoid overlap patterns that trigger Sybil filters.Example:rust
//
// use petgraph::Graph;
//
// pub fn build_wallet_graph(wallets: Vec<Wallet>) -> Graph<Wallet, f32> {
//     let mut graph = Graph::new();
//     // Add nodes and edges based on similarity
//     graph
// }


// Persistent Wallet Graph Modeling (src/orchestration/wallet_graph.rs)Purpose: Tracks wallet relationships to prevent Sybil detection by ensuring diverse activity patterns.
// Implementation: Use petgraph to store a directed graph, updating it with each action. Analyze clusters to adjust coordinator.rs strategies.
